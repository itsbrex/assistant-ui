The payload's `$input` takes one of two shapes: a single value for a standalone control's dispatch (`Select`, `Input`, `DatePicker`, `Checkbox`, `RadioGroup`, or a `CheckboxGroup`'s array of checked values), or an object keyed by field `name` for a `Form` or a `Card` with `asForm` set. When a registry is used in a `JSONGenerativeUI` tool, each dispatched payload, including `$input`, is recorded on the tool call on a best-effort basis. Recording depends on the runtime and interaction log limits, and never delays or prevents dispatch. Construct it with {@link createActionRegistry} and pass it to `JSONGenerativeUI`.
